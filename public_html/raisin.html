            <h6 class="section-title text-center">A Raisin in the Sun</h6>
            <h6 class="section-subtitle text-center mb-5 pb-3">In 1959, Lorraine Hansberry's play A Raisin in the Sun made its Broadway debut. The poem "Harlem" by Langston Hughes, sometimes known as "A Dream Deferred," is where the title originates.</h6>
                            <center><h5 class="card-title"> The Youngers are a poor African-American family living on the South Side of Chicago. An opportunity to escape from poverty comes in the form of a $10,000 life insurance check that the matriarch of the family (Lena Younger or Mama) receives upon her husband's death. Lena's children, Walter and Beneatha, each have their plans for the money. The oldest son, Walter (a man of 35 with a wife and a young son), wishes to invest in a liquor store. The younger sister, Beneatha, currently a college student, wants to use the money for medical school. Lena has plans as well for the money: she wants to buy a house for the family and finance Beneatha's medical school.
<br>
<br>
The environmental pressures are high: five people live in a tiny one-bedroom apartment, two families share a single bathroom, and the building is run-down and roach-infested. These pressures increase when Walter's wife, Ruth, finds out that she is pregnant for the second time, and begins seriously contemplating <a href="" class="a" data-tip="ABORTION(verb) - the termination of a pregnancy after, accompanied by, resulting in, or closely followed by the death of the embryo or fetus">abortion</a>. Yet even in an environment where a request for fifty cents becomes a family conflict, there is room for ideas and dreams.
<br>
<br>
Beneatha Younger is the source of the many of the new ideas and philosophies that infiltrate the family's home. Currently in college, she is constantly challenging the notions of culture, race, gender, and religion that her family has grown up with. She is dating two men who represent very different aspects of African-American culture. George Murchison, the first, is a wealthy African-American classmate of Beneatha's. Through his character, Hansberry is able to illustrate many of the class tensions that exist within the African-American culture. Asagai is her second boyfriend, a college student who is from Nigeria. Through Asagai, Beneatha is able to learn more about her African heritage. He gives her Nigerian robes and music, encourages her idealistic aspirations, and near the end of the play invites her to return to Nigeria with him to practice medicine there.
<br>
<br>
Walter Younger truly encapsulates the American dream. He has a genuine entrepreneurial spirit and desire to progress. Walter doesn't want to challenge the present system as Beneatha does. Instead, he wishes to progress up the social ladder into a higher class. He is unsatisfied with his job as a <a href="" class="a" data-tip="CHAUFFEUR(noun) - a person employed to drive a motor vehicle">chauffeur</a>, and wants a big house, a nice car, pearls for his wife, and an office job. In short, he desires the <a href="" class="a" data-tip="BOURGEOISIE(noun) - a woman of the middle class">bourgeoisie</a>bourgeoisie lifestyle. Walter's idolization of wealth and power actually creates a deep hunger within him for change, but as long as obstacles like racism keep him <a href="" class="a" data-tip="STAGNATED(adjective) - to become or remain stagnant">stagnated</a>, his hopes and dreams fester. After several events, Mama realizes the significance of his plans even though she morally objects to the idea of a liquor store.
<br>
<br>
After having made the down payment on a house in a predominantly white neighborhood, Lena gives her oldest son responsibility over the rest of the insurance money, asking him to put away a significant portion for his sister's medical school education. To the contrary, Walter decides to invest all the money in the liquor store business with two men of questionable character. The plan falls through when Willy, one of the "investors", runs away with all of the money.
<br>
<br>
The family is entirely dependent on the money: they already have made plans to move, and are in the midst of packing up their things. Devastated, Walter seriously considers taking an offer from Mr. Lindner, a representative from the white neighborhood, that would pay the Youngers extra not to move into their neighborhood. The option is immoral in the family's eyes, and prioritizes money over human dignity. Walter is determined to make the deal despite his scruples, but at the last moment Walter is unable to make the transaction under the innocent gaze of his son, Travis. In the end, the family decides to move. Even though the road ahead will be difficult, they know that they have made an honorable choice.</h5></center>

                        <p>Lorraine Vivian Hansberry is a dramatist and writer from the United States. She was the first African-American female author whose work was staged on Broadway. Her most well-known work, the play A Raisin in the Sun, examines the lives of divided black people in Chicago. The title of the play was inspired by Langston Hughes' poem "Harlem," which asks, "What happens to a dream deferred? Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun?" At the age of 29, she became the first African-American dramatist, the fifth woman, and the youngest playwright to win the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award.</p>
